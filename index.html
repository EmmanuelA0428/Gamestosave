            <h2>Our Mission </h2>
            <p> The feeling you get when you lend a helping hand, is one that triumphs all. We live in a society today where people need compassion more than ever. With that said, I think there is a misconception about giving or helping others. You do not need wealth, confidence, or material things in order to give. All you need is a heart full of love, and you are set. We made this website to give an opportunity to those less fortunate to give and experience what it is like to change someone's life. Through our innovative system, people can earn reward points, which directly correlate to actual money. By playing fun games, interacting with others, completing surveys and many more players can earn points which can be donated to a cause they strongly believe in. Kids all around the world can now have fun and give back at the same time. The feeling of knowing that, because of me, someone is going to eat today, sleep well tonight, and have a quality day is beyond anything imaginable. <br><br> <strong>"Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more."</strong> </p>
